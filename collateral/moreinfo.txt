I potentially have a 1975 Rock-ola 459 for our kitchen.

It has Freeplay - i.e. you can select a song and it will play it without any money
It does not have Autoplay - i.e. it won't just play a continuous selection of songs

My wife is keen on Autoplay for when she is cooking and doesn't want to walk over after every couple of songs.

I came up with the idea of using a Raspberry Pi to control a 32-Ch Relay Module via a RS485 CAN Hat

I have now written a web app that allows the following

* Select one or more songs
* Select and play one or more playlists
* Select and play all songs

The software take the requested song and sends it to the relay to 'flash-on' the appropriate selector buttons
(in this case for 0.2 seconds) - doing each of the 3 buttons required to select a song in order

All of the functionality upto controlling the command side of the relay is well within my capability

It's how to wire this to the control buttons on the console that I need help or better still someone to help me do

In addition I can use the audio out from Raspberry pi between the pre-amp and main amp allowing me to stream other music and just use the speakers

The software has been written in such a way that this could be used with any similar jukebox - just needs the relay settings added to a config file.
If I complete this then it would also allow it to autoboot and join a new network, etc.
I would then open source the entire project (it's already in GitHub as I develop the functionality)
