Hi Ben/Polly

I went to see Stephen Clothier and the Rock-Ola 459 the other day - it is a nice machine

I've been rapidly learning about these things and obviously it is an old piece of kit - I have several Citronics 1970s DJ Decks

I am wondering what it would cost to 'enhance' the unit and would you be able to help do it.

There are three things I would like to do

The first is change the selector display at the top - this is cosmetic and I can probably live without if it is expensive

The second thing is to have autoplay so that it will just play a series of records - this apparently wasn't a feature available for the system

The third thing is to be able to use the speakers to play music from an external source - again not available in this unit.

I've done some research it strikes me that I could potentially upgrade the system to do this.

My plan would be to put a Raspberry Pi into the unit

The Raspberry Pi would have a Behringer UCA202 USB to RCA converter that could be connected after the Pre-Amp at Line level

The Raspberry Pi can also control a 32-Ch Relay Module via a RS485 CAN Hat

The Raspberry Pi would also need a UPS for graceful shutdown

The Raspberry Pi and the Relay Module would also need power (probably easist via their standard 240V transformers)
The Relay needs 12V 2A 2.1mm DC Barrel Jack and the Raspberry Pi 5V 5A via USB-C

It is the wiring of all this that I need help on - would you be able to wire in the speaker RCA and the Relay to the push buttons or the selector circuitary

Would you be able to do this and any idea how much it would cost?
Also if there is a better way to achive this let me know :-)

I am a retired CTO & programmer so the software part is easy. I've already knocked up some rough code

I would write and publish open source packages that would

* Linear Autoplay (101, 102, 103, 104, 111, etc.)
* Random Autoplay (pick songs at random, no repeats until all played)
* Allow remote song selection
* Allow multiple play lists
* Allow Spotify streaming to speaker
* Allow Apple Airplay streaming to speaker

* Web interface configuration
* Apple App Integration
* MQTT intgeration

* Wifi Connection & Management 

Finally I found a 456 Service Manual online - let me know if you would like a copy (I assume you already have one but just in case)

All the best
